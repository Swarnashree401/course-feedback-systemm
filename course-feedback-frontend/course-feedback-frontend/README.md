# Course Feedback Frontend (minimal)

This is a minimal frontend that communicates with the backend at http://localhost:5000 by default.

## Quick start

1. Unzip this folder and push to GitHub.
2. You can serve the `static` folder contents using any static server.
   For development, open `static/index.html` in a browser (or use a simple server).
3. The app talks to backend at `http://localhost:5000/api`.

Note: This is a lightweight static frontend (no build step). It's ready to push as-is.
